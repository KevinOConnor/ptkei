PENDING IDENTIFIED BUGS LIST

* When the BIG_CITY option is enabled, sector 'c' are called 'city'
  instead of 'capital' and thus are not recognised.

* Efficiency prediction is wrong when the sector needs lcms and hcms
  to increase its efficiency.

* When taking a sector, all enemy land units that were present in that
  sector are either destroyed or move to some other sector.  Thus they
  at least should be removed from the list.

* Due to the configuration of Python 2.1 on Debian, when a non ascii
  character is entered it raises an exception.

FEATURES TO BE ADDED

* Improve the 'remove' command so that the user can use a classic unit
  specification such as 'remove land #1' or 'remove ship * ?own#-1'.

* Add a keyboard shortcut to switch between the various left panels.
  This issue could be solved differently.  Basically, I seldom use the
  unit panel except to get the list of the units present in a sector.
  Maybe could we add this list at the bottom of the sector display.
