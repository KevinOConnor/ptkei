    <h1>The Python/Tk Empire Interface</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Python/Tk Empire Interface.</p>

<p>The Python/Tk Empire Interface (which is often referred to as
PTkEI) is a python based interpretive client for the empire server. </p>

<p>This documentation refers to release 1.15.0 <br> The release date
for the 1.15.0 version is 2002-07-01. </p>

    <p>This client is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL.</p>

<p> Author: Kevin O'Connor
      <br>Current maintainer: Laurent Martin </p>



    <h2>Introduction and Availability</h2>

    <p>This program enables you to play modern variants of the mighty
    empire game over the Internet.  Empire is a real-time war game
    that has a long tradition.  At the time of this writing, the
    Empire Homepage can be located at: <a
    href="http://www.empire.cx/"> http://www.empire.cx </a>. You can
    find out about Empire and currently running servers here.  This is
    also the place to download PTkEI and other clients.

    <p>This program is a client only.  If you are not familiar with
    Empire and the Empire server, then you will definitely need to
    read the <a href="http://www.empire.cx">empire</a> documentation
    in addition to the client documentation. </p>

    <p> The most recent development versions of this client can
    currently be found at: <a
    href="http://www.lfmm.org/ptkei/">http://www.lfmm.org/ptkei/</a>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>In order to run this client, you must have the Python
    interpreter installed on your system.  The interpreter must be
    version 1.5 or later. </p>

    <p>In order to use the graphical portions of this client, you must
    have the Tcl/Tk libraries installed, and you must have a version
    of Python that is configured to work with Tk. </p>

    <p>To obtain the Python interpreter and Tcl/Tk libraries, see the
    instructions located at the main Python web site: <a
    href="http://www.python.org/"> http://www.python.org/ </a> </p>

    <h2>Quick Start</h2>

    <p>For the highly impatient, these are the files that I downloaded
    when testing the client: </p>

    <h3>Windows Users</h3>

    <p>Go to the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> web site
    located in the <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">download
    section</a> and download the file <a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.1/Python-2.2.1.exe">Python-2.2.1.exe</a>. </p>

    <p> After installing the python distribution, unpack the PTkEI
    archive, and double click on the file 'empire.py' to run the
    client. </p>

    <h3>Linux RedHat Users</h3>

    <p>The RedHat Manhattan distribution (5.1) and later comes bundled
    with python.  Simply unpack the PTkEI archive and run the command
    'empire.py'.

    <h3>Other Unix Users</h3>

    <p>If python is not already installed, it will probably be
    necessary to compile the source code.  Check out the <a
    href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python download page</a>,
    it has the source code and install directions.  When compiling, be
    sure to activate the Tk interface in the Python distribution's
    Modules/Setup file; it is not on by default. </p>

    <h3>Macintosh Users</h3>

    <p>These instructions are available courtesy of Dan DEOCAMPO:

    <ol>
      <li>Download and install python from their website (www.python.org?)
      <li>Download ptkei.
      <li>Click "empire.py" and drag it onto the icon that says "Make Applet"
	that should have been installed by Python.  This creates the
	executable application "empire".
      <li>Click "empire", and "get info" (from the File menu up top of
	screen), and increase the memory allocation (I use 15 megs just to
	be safe, but I'm sure you could use less).
      <li>Double click "empire" and you're in - host address window asks you
	where to connect.  I'm sure there's an easier way to deal with it,
	but when I want to change to a different host, I throw out the file
	"EmpDB" before I double-click empire. (Authors Note:  This should
	no longer be necessary - try using the Load/Save buttons from the
	Login window.)
    </ol>

    <h2>Available Platforms</h2>

    <p>Currently, this client has been tested on Win95, Win98, WinNT,
    Macintosh and a variety of Unix machines.  The client should be
    functional on other platforms as well.  If Python is available for
    the platform and it supports the Tcl/Tk interface, it should be
    able to run.  Please let me know if you succeed or fail at any
      attempted installations. </p>

    <p>I have tried repeatedly to get the client to work on Windows
    3.1.  Unfortunately, due to problems with Python on this platform
    it seems unlikely that this will be easily doable.  (It will
    probably require a re-compile of the Python distribution..) </p>

    <h2>Running the Client</h2>

    <p>Once you have verified that Python is properly installed,
    unpack the client and 'cd' into the client directory.  Included in
    the distribution should be the file 'empire.py'.  This file should
    be executable; simply run the file to start the client.  (If this
    causes problems, try running the command '<kbd>python
    empire.py</kbd>'.)

    <p>Optionally, the client may be invoked using the syntax,
    'empire.py &lt;<var>filename</var>&gt;' to specify a file to store
    the database in.  (If no name is specified, the file defaults to
    'EmpDB'.)  In addition to specifying the database filename, a
    number of additional options may be provided.  Please see the <a
    href="TIPS.html#commandline">command-line</a> section of the TIPS
    file for more information.

    <p>If the server disconnects the client because of an inactivity
    timeout or because of a 'bye' command, the client will idle until
    the next command is issued (at which time PTkEI will automatically
    reconnect).  To exit the client, you must close the main window
    via the window manager.

    <p>When a database is first initialized the client will prompt for
    server and country information.  The database file will recall
    this information for future connections.  If you change these
    values using the 'change' command, you will have to enter the new
    values the next time the client attempts to reconnect.

    <p>PTkEI can also be run without a graphical display.  Reverting
    back to a text interface is highly unrecommended and nearly
    unsupported.  In a crunch, however, the client will operate nearly
    identically to the standard empClient.  (A graphical connection is
    automatically used when available; the client will only revert to
    text when no graphics are permitted or when there is an error
    connecting to the display.)


    <h2>Taking Over The World</h2>

    <p>The client should be fairly simple to operate.  All keystrokes
    are sent directly to the command-line like most other Empire
    clients.  However, this client will 'automagically' parse output
    from dump, map, and many other commands.  It will then seamlessly
    update the graphical displays.  To refresh these displays, simply
    send new map/dump commands.  There is also a built-in command
    ('rdb') that will issue dump commands that make use of the new
    Wolfpack 4.0 timestamps.  'rdb' dumps only those sectors that have
    recently changed - it is the recommended interface to the dump
    command.  See the <a href="TIPS.html#refresh">Refreshing</a>
    section of TIPS.html for more information.

    <p>Currently, the graphical interface includes a scrollable map
    window, a selectable censor window, a telegram and annoucement
    window, and several other 'nifty' features.

    <p>There are a few 'smart' features available.  Please see the
    file <a href="commands.html">commands.html</a> for a description
    of these commands.  The GUI functions are described in <a
    href="gui.html">gui.html</a>.  Other miscellaneous information can
    be found in the <a href="TIPS.html">TIPS.html</a> file.


    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

    <p>If there are problems starting the client, then it may be
    necessary to debug the Python and/or Tk installations.  I
    recommend reading the section titled 'Troubleshooting' at the web
    page: <a
    href="http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/">http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/</a>.
    The idea is to start the python interpreter manually (usually by
    running '<kbd>python</kbd>' from a command prompt), and type in
    the command '<kbd>import Tkinter</kbd>' followed by the command
    '<kbd>Tkinter._test()</kbd>'.  If a window pops up, then the
    Python/Tk setup is probably ok, otherwise there is an error
    somewhere in the installation.

    <p>Also, if the client is running under Windows, be sure to read the
section located at: <br> <a
href="http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/download.html#autoexec">
http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/download.html#autoexec </a> <br> This
link describes the process of adding TCL to the standard PATH variable at
boot time.


    <h2>Upgrading the Database</h2>
									
    <p>The database format used by Ptkei 1.14.0 differs slightly from
    the one used by previous versions.  The Python script
    <tt>updateDB.py</tt> will make a new database.

    <pre>updateDB.py [filename]</pre>

    <p>Called without argument, <tt>updateDB.py</tt> assumes that the
    database to convert is called <tt>empDB</tt> and is located in the
    current directory. </p>

    <p>It first renames the database <tt>foo</tt> to <tt>foo.old</tt>,
    then creates a new database <tt>foo</tt> using the format of Ptkei
    1.14.0. </p>
