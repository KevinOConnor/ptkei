    <p>This file is intended to give a brief summary of the "smart"
    commands available in the Python/Tk empire client.</p>

    <p> Each of the following commands may be entered as if they were
    a normal empire server command.  The client will automatically
    recognize these commands and handle them locally, where
    applicable. </p>

    <p> In addition to commands that are typed in on the command line,
    commands can also be specified in three built-in configuration
    files.  The file, "first.emp" is executed the first time the
    client connects to the server, "start.emp" is run every time the
    client starts up, and the file "connect.emp" is run each time a
    connection is made to the server. </p>

    <p> Important Change!  Previous versions of the client had a
    command known as "sync".  This command has be renamed to "rdb",
    and its syntax has been altered! </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Basic Commands</h2>

    <h3><a name="rdb">Command rdb</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>  

    <pre>rdb</pre> 

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This command is used to keep the sector/ship/plane/nuke/etc
    databases synchronized.  When this command is issued
    dump/sdump/pdump/ldump/lost commands will be buffered to the
    server.  Empire 4.x timestamps are used to ensure only recently
    updated values are returned.  It is a good idea to use this
    command instead of manually running dump yourself. </p>

    <p> At one time, the server had a bug that caused empire updates
    to modify sectors and units without updating the timestamps.  To
    circumvent this problem, 'rdb' was expanded to use the form
    'rerdb'.  A "re-refresh" will force this command to ignore
    timestamps and dump the entire database.  It should not be
    necessary to use this form of the command. </p>

    <p> Additionally, the command rdb (or rerdb) may contain a suffix
    that contains any combination of 'epslno'.  'e' stands for sector
    dump, 'p' is a plane dump, 's' is a ship dump, 'l' is a land dump,
    'n' is a nuke dump, and 'o' is a lost dump.  When these selectors
    are specified, only the corresponding dumps will be sent.  This is
    useful when it is known which databases have changed, and it is
    not desirable to dump all the databases.  For example, you might
    specify 'rdbel' to synchronize just sectors and land units. </p>

    <p> During processing of the outgoing command queue, if two or
    more rdb commands are buffered simultaneously, the client will
    automatically ignore the first database refresh.  Since the first
    refresh is contained entirely within the second, it doesn't make
    much sense to send the first.  When this behavior is not desired,
    the rdb command can be suffixed with a "P" flag.  This prevents
    the first rdb command from being ignored. </p>

    <h3><a name="null">Command null</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    <pre>null &lt;cmd&gt;</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>Send &lt;cmd&gt; to server, but don't display its
    output on the command-line.  The output will still be parsed by
    the internal parsers.  For example, "null map *" will update the
    graphical display without flooding the output window. </p>

    <h3><a name="multicmd">Multi Command Line</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>&lt;cmd1&gt; ; &lt;cmd2&gt;</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This command allows multiple commands to be sent on the same
    line.  For example, "map * ; bmap *" will send "map *" followed by
    "bmap *". </p>

    <h3><a name="redir">Redirections</a></h3>

    <p>These  commands redirect the output of an empire command. </p>

    <pre>&lt;cmd&gt; | &lt;program&gt;</pre>
    <p>Send output of &lt;cmd&gt; to the system command
		&lt;program&gt;</p>

    <pre>&lt;cmd&gt; &gt; &lt;file&gt;</pre>

    <p>Store output of &lt;cmd&gt; in new file called
    &lt;file&gt;</p>

    <pre>&lt;cmd&gt; &gt;! &lt;file&gt;</pre>

    <p>Store output of &lt;cmd&gt; in file named
    &lt;file&gt;, overwriting an existing file if any. </p>

    <pre>&lt;cmd&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;file&gt;</pre>

    <p>Store output of &lt;cmd&gt; at the end of the file
    &lt;file&gt; </p>


    <h3><a name="execute">Commands execute &amp; runfeed</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    
    <pre>execute &lt;file&gt;</pre>

    <pre>runfeed &lt;program&gt;</pre>

    <p>These commands allow server commands to be collected in an
    external source.  When processing the commands, lines beginning
    with a "#" are considered comments and are silently ignored.  All
    other lines are interpreted as client or server commands.

    <p>The "execute" command may be abbreviated to as short as "exe".
    This command is intended to mimic the effects of the similar
    server based command.


    <h3><a name="alias">Command alias</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>alias &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;newcmd&gt;</pre>

    <p>All future invocations of &lt;cmd&gt; will
    automagically be altered to send &lt;newcmd&gt;
    instead.  Optionally, the alias may contain special substitution
    characters.  When evaluating, the sequence $* is substituted with
    the command's arguments, $X is substituted for the Xth word of the
    command's arguments ($0 will be replaced by the command name), and
    $$ is replaced by a single $ character.  For example, the command
    &quot;alias mvoe move $*&quot;, makes mvoe function exactly like
    move.

    <p>To make an alias permanent, place the alias command in the
    start.emp file.  There are also many examples of aliases in this
    file.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is no protection from infinitely
    recursing aliases.  If an alias calls itself it will probably end
    up hanging the client!

    <p><strong>Note2:</strong> When in <a href="TIPS.html#burst">burst
    mode</a> aliases may also be evaluated for sub-prompts.  Because
    of this, it is a good idea to plan out aliases that don't easily
    conflict with common empire sub-prompts.

    <h3><a name="burst">Command burst</a></h3>
    
    <pre>burst &lt;cmd&gt;</pre>

    <p>The burst command can be used to send a series of commands to
    the server without synchronizing the output.  Synchronizing output
    can incur a significant amount of latency.  By "bursting" multiple
    commands simultaneously, a significant improvement can be made to
    the overall connection speed.  Unfortunately, when multiple
    commands are "bursted", it becomes possible for a command to
    accidently answer the preceding command's sub-prompt.  This
    utility is most powerful when it is applied to commands whose
    sub-prompts (or lack of sub-prompts) can be entirely predicted.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The internal parser will parse bursted commands!

    <p>Simple examples:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd>burst tele 4;Hi there.;What's up?;.</kbd>
      <dd>
	This command will burst the 4 lines of data ('tele 4', 'Hi there.',
	'What's up?', and '.').  Because telegram has predictable
	sub-prompts, it is safe to assume that the above will tele 4 with
	the included message.

      <dt><kbd>burst nation;version;update;map *</kbd>
      <dd>
	This command will send the four specified commands simultaneously.
	Because nation, version, and update never take sub-prompts, and
	because map has a predictable sub-prompt - It is safe to assume
	that these commands will execute properly.
    </dl>

    <p> For a more in depth analysis, see the <a
    href="TIPS.html#burst">burst section</a> in the TIPS file.  There
    are also a number of examples in the default start.emp file.

    <h3><a name="origin">Command origin</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    
    <pre>origin</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>Block unsupported server command.</p>

    <p>The server origin command is not supported by the client.  To
    prevent accidental error, this command will be blocked before
    transmission to the server.  Please see the <a
    href="TIPS.html#origin">origin section</a> of the TIPS.html file
    for more information.


    <h3><a name="raw">Command raw</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>raw &lt;cmd&gt;</pre>

    <p>Normally, all commands typed in are checked for client
    synthetic commands and aliases.  The raw command can be used to
    prevent this check.  When using this command, everything following
    "raw" will be sent to the server completely unmodified.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The client will still parse the output
    from commands that are sent raw!

    <p><strong>WARNING!</strong> In raw mode, it is possible to send
    the command "exec" to the server.  The client does not support the
    server's exec protocols.  If exec is sent in raw mode, it may
    become necessary to disconnect via the Login Window to reset the
    client's connection.

    <h3><a name="remove">Command remove</a></h3>
    
    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>remove (l|s|p) &lt;sects&gt;</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>Sometimes foreign units are still present in the database while
    they're not visible anymore or have been destroyed.  The "remove"
    command allows the user to remove such units. Example:

    <p><code>remove&nbsp;s&nbsp;*</code> will remove all foreign ships
    from the database.

    <p><code>remove l #1</code> will remove all land units from realm
    1.

    <h3><a name="dtele">Command dtele</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>dtele</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>All telegrams sent or received are copied to the screen or can
    be redirected to a file with the usual rediction operators.

    <p><code>dtele >! tele.txt</code> will send all telegrams to the
    file 'tele.txt'. </p>

    <h3><a name="danno">Command danno</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>danno</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>All announcements sent or received are copied to the screen or
    can be redirected to a file with the usual rediction operators.
      
    <p><code>danno >! anno.txt</code> will send all announcements to
    the file 'anno.txt'. </p>

    <h3><a name="projection">Command projection</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>projection</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This command tells you if one or more of your sectors needs
    more commodity, availibility to build all your units (ships,
    planes and land units).  You need to have issued a 'show
    ship|plane|land build' before.</p>

    <p>Some examples:</p>

    <pre>[71:640] Command : projection
Building Projections
====================
[71:640] Command : 
</pre>
    <p>It seems that you're not building anything this update!</p>


<pre>[72:637] Command : projection
Building Projections
====================
<font color="#ff0000">You should issue a 'show plane build' command to update the database</font>
[72:637] Command : </pre>

    <p>The type of planes you're building isn't present in your
    database: You've never issued a 'show plane build' or maybe you
    did but so long ago that this new plane type didn't exist at that
    time.  You must send a 'show plane build' to get all plane types. </p>

    <pre>[75:636] Command : projection
Building Projections
====================
Sector 6,2 is ok.
[75:636] Command : </pre>

    <p>Sector 6,2 has all needed commodity to build your units. </p>

    <pre>75:635] Command : projection
Building Projections
====================
Sector 7,-1 needs 59 more lcm
Sector 7,-1 needs 5 more mil
Sector 6,2 is ok.
[75:635] Command : </pre>

    <p>Sector 7,-1 (an airport) needs 59 more lcms and 5 more mils to
    make all the planes located there 100%. </p>

    <h2>Tk Window Commands</h2>

    <p>What follows is a quick summary of the Tk based commands.  Many
    of these commands are further documented in the <a
    href="gui.html">gui.html</a> file.

      <h3><a name="wind">Command wind</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>wind &lt;cmd&gt;</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>Send &lt;cmd&gt; to server, pop-up a new window on
    the desktop, and redirect all output from the command to this
    window.  For example, the command "wind info Products" would send
    that 20 page manual to its own window with its own scrollbar.
    This window can then be left up for future reference; it will not
    interfere with sending and receiving of additional empire
    commands.  An unlimited number of these output windows may be used
    simultaneously.

    <h3><a name="wread">Command wread</a></h3>
    
    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>wread</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>The internal parsers automatically store incoming telegrams,
    incoming announcements, and outgoing telegrams.  Sending this
    command will pop up a graphical telegram window which allows
    reviewing and responding to these messages.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are short on disk space, you may
    have to use this tool to delete old telegrams and announcements
    from the database.  Since the client automatically stores old
    messages, the database can become rather large over time.

    <h3><a name="Map">Command Map</a></h3>
    
    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>Map</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>
      
    <p>This command will pop up an additional graphical map in its own
    desktop window.  An unlimited number of these map windows may be
    used simultaneously, and each map window can have its own origin
    and scale. </p>

    <h3><a name="cshow">Command cshow</a></h3>
    
    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>cshow &lt;'ship'|'land'|'plane'&gt;</pre>
    
    <h4>Description</h4>
    
    <p>This command will send "show X build; show X cap; show X sta"
    and rearrange the output into multiple columns.  A Tk window will
    pop up with the resulting formatted display.


    <h3><a name="Login">Command Login</a></h3>
    
    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>Login</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This command forces the Tk interface to re-open the Login
    window.  When connected to a server, the login window may be used
    to force a disconnect.  When not connected to a server, the Login
    window can be used to alter database, server, and country
    information.

    <h3><a name="Sect">Command Sect</a></h3>
    
    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>Sect &lt;sectors&gt; [&lt;selectors&gt;]</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>
      
    <p>This command locally emulates the empire server's sect command.
    It can be used to mark sectors on the graphical map that meet a
    provided empire selector.  It is intended to work similar to the
    server based "sect" command.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This command uses the internal database
    to determine which sectors apply.  If the database is not
    synchronized, the results will not be correct!

    <p>The arguments to sect work in the same manner as the foreach
    command which is described below.

    <p>Optionally, you may run the Sect command with no arguments at
    all to erase the highlights from any past Sect commands.

    <h3><a name="Disp">Command Disp</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>Disp &lt;commodity&gt; &lt;sectors&gt; [&lt;selectors&gt;] [min &lt;min value&gt;] [max &lt;max value&gt;]</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This commands highlights selected sectors using a color
    gradient depending on the level of the commodity specified.  If
    the &lt;min value&gt; is set all levels below it are seen as if
    they were egal to this &lt;min value&gt;.  The same applies for
    the &lt;max value&gt;.
      
    <p>Like the Sect command, Disp uses the internal database.  

    <p>You may run the Disp command without any arguments to erase the
    highlights from any past Disp commands.
      
    <h2> Smart Commands</h2>

    <h3><a name="eval">Command eval</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>eval nation|version|&lt;sect&gt; &lt;cmd&gt;</pre>
		
    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This command allows a command to contain python expressions
    that are evaluated using the nation database, the version
    database, or a sector database.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This command uses the internal database.
    If the database is not synchronized, the results will not be
    correct!

    <p>&lt;sect&gt; is a sector designation of the form x,y.  (Note,
    if you wish to run a programmable-command on many sectors, use the
    foreach command.)  This sector's database is referenced when
    evaluation the rest of the command.

    <p>&lt;cmd&gt; is an empire command that contains an arbitrary
    number of python expressions embedded within it.  The python
    expressions must be enclosed within [ and ] characters (the square
    brackets).  These python expressions are evaluated using a
    namespace from the specified database.  The names of the variables
    are the same as their corresponding empire selectors, and similar
    to the empire selectors they may be abbreviated (for example, both
    'newdes' and 'new' are equivalent).  In addition to the standard
    empire selectors, there are two included aliases: sect (A string
    containing the sector's x,y pair), and dist (A string containing
    the dist_x,dist_y pair).  See the <a
    href="TIPS.html#selectors">selectors section</a> of the TIPS file
    for more information.

    <p>An example:

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd> eval 0,0 move mil [dist] [mob/2+1-mil] [sect] ; anti
	  [sect]</kbd>

      <dd>In this example, enough mil is pulled in from sector 0,0's
      dist center so that the maximum number of mil usable in an anti
      command is available.  The anti command is then executed.
    </dl>


    <h3><a name="foreach">Command foreach</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    
    <pre>foreach &lt;sectors&gt; [&lt;selectors&gt;] &lt;cmd&gt; </pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    
    <p>Similar to the PEI foreach command, this command takes a sector
    range, an optional
    ?&lt;var&gt;=&lt;val&gt;&amp;... selector,
    and then runs cmd on each sector that meets the requirements.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This command uses the internal database.
    If the database is not synchronized, the results will not be
    correct!

    <p>&lt;sectors&gt; and &lt;selectors&gt; are
    similar to those on the empire server.  &lt;sectors&gt;
    can be a range of sectors (x1:x2,y1:y2), an '*' to specify all
    sectors, or an empire range of the form '#X'.
    &lt;selectors&gt; is a series of variable conditions
    that may be specified using the form
    &quot;?&lt;var&gt;&lt;cond&gt;&lt;var&gt;&quot;
    where &lt;var&gt; is a either a constant or a valid
    empire variable, and cond is one of '=', '&lt;', '&gt;'
    or '#'.  Any number of selectors may be specified by appending
    them with a '&amp;' character in-between.  See the <a
    href="TIPS.html#selectors">empire selectors</a> section of the
    TIPS.html file for advanced information.

    <p>&lt;cmd&gt; is a string that will be parsed in the
    same manner as the eval command.

    <p>An example:

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd> foreach * ?dust=1&amp;d_dist=0 move d [sect] 1 4,7 </kbd>
      <dd>
	The above command moves 1 dust to sector 4,7 from all sectors that have
	exactly 1 dust and have no dust threshold.
    </dl>
    
    <p>A more complex example:
    <dl>
      <dt><kbd> foreach * ?mil&lt;50 move mil [dist] [50-mil] [sect] </kbd>
      <dd>
	The above attempts to resupply all sectors from their respective dist
	centers so that all sectors have a minimum of 50 mil.
    </dl>
    
    <p>An insane example:

      '+sect or sect+' '+`gun-10`+' '+dist] </kbd>
      <dd>
	The above moves guns around so that exactly 10 guns are in
	every sector.  Sectors that have more than 10 guns in them
	move guns to their dist centers; sectors with less than 10
	guns move guns from their dist sectors.

    <h3><a name="nova">Command nova</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>nova &lt;civ|mil&gt; &lt;start sector&gt; [&lt;to sector&gt;]</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>The start sector has to be an owned sector that contains
    mobility and civs/mil.  If [to sector] is specified, it
    must be an owned sector that is adjacent to unowned wilderness.
    (If [to sector] is not specified then start
    sector must be adjacent to unowned wilderness.)  Explore
    commands are then generated from the start sector to all adjacent
    wilderness sectors.  No best path is calculated.


    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This command is experimental!  Do not
    use it in important situations.  (But it might be useful in
    blitzes.)  It uses the internal database, which has to be
    synchronized.

    <h3><a name="mmove">Command mmove</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>mmove &lt;commodity&gt; &lt;source sectors&gt; &lt;min level&gt; &lt;mobility&gt; &lt;dest sectors&gt; &lt;max level&gt;</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>Invoking mmove will generate a series of commands that attempt
    to move the commodity specified by &lt;commodity&gt; from the
    sectors in &lt;source sectors&gt; so that there is &lt;max
    level&gt; of the commodity in all the sectors in &lt;dest
    sectors&gt; such that all source sectors will not go below &lt;min
    level&gt; of the commodity and not go below &lt;mobility&gt;
    mobility.. Phew..

    <p>Ok, an example:

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd> mmove food * 60 40 * 60 </kbd>
      <dd>
      This moves food from sectors with more than 60 food to sectors with
      less than 60 food.  At least 40 mobility will be left in every
      sector.

	<p>
      <dt> <kbd> mmove civ #1 768 80 #2 ?new#+ 768 </kbd>
      <dd>
	This will attempt to move civs from sectors in realm 1 that have more
	than 768 civs to sectors in realm 2 that have less than 768 civs and
	are not road sectors.  At least 80 mobility is left in each sector.
    </dl>

    <p>The mmove utility is a contribution from Ulf Larsson.  Warning!
    This code is still experimental!  Please use with discretion.

    <h3><a name="dmove">Command dmove</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>dmove &lt;commodity&gt; &lt;source sectors&gt; &lt;mobility&gt; [zero] [&lt;dest sectors&gt;]</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>The dmove command behaves like mmove except that the commodity
    levels used are the distribution thresholds. Unless the
    <em>zero</em> argument is provided, a sector with no commodity
    threshold (i.e. a threshold equal to zero) won't be included in
    the source sectors. The difference between this command and mmove
    is that each sector can have a different min level or max
    level.</p>
    
    <h4>Examples</h4>

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd>dmove i * 67</kbd></dt> 

      <dd>This command will generate a list of move commands from
      sectors where the stock of iron is above the iron threshold (and
      where the iron threshold is greater of equal to one) to sectors
      where the stock of iron is below the iron threshold.  The amount
      of iron in source sectors won't go below their iron thresholds
      and in destination sectors it won't go above their
      thresholds. </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd>thr d * ?dust=1&amp;gold=0 0<br>rdb<br>dmove d * 67 zero</kbd>

      <dd>The first command sets the threshold of sectors that used to
      be gold mine where 1 dust is remaining to 0.  The second
      refreshes the database.  Finally, the third one will move
      commodity from these sectors to those where dust level is below
      thresholds (for instance banks, tech centers). </dd>

    </dl>
    <h3><a name="Mover">Command Mover</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>Mover &lt;commodity&gt; &lt;amount&gt; &lt;sector list&gt;</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>The Mover utility moves amount of commodity from the
first sector of sector list to the second sector of sector
list, to the third sector, fourth sector, and so on until the
commodity resides in the last sector of sector list .  The
purpose of this utility is to move commodities around using way-points as
mobility sinks.

    <p> The amount field has a special meaning in this utility:
      
    <ul>
      
      <li>If amount is a normal number than it represents the amount
      of the commodity that will reside in the last sector after a
      successful move.  If amount is greater than the quantity in the
      last sector then commodities will be moved to the first sector;
      if amount is less, than commodities will be moved from the first
      sector. </li>

      <li>If amount is prefaced with a minus sign ('-'), than amount
	represents an absolute move.  The amount specified will be moved
	from the last sector to the first sector.

      <li>If amount is prefaced with a plus sign ('+'), than amount
	represents an absolute move.  This is identical to the above,
	except the amount will be moved from the first sector to the last
	sector.

      <li>If amount is prefaced with an at sign ('@'), than it moves
	commodities so that amount is left in the first sector.  This is
	identical to the unsigned type, except the first sector's level is
	used instead of the last sector.
</ul>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This command is still in its infancy.
    Both it and the graphical move utility, which uses this command,
    should be used with a little caution.  Also, this command has no
    support for moves that cause enemy interdiction.  If interdiction
    occurs, it will probably not do what you want.

    <h3><a name="Predict">Command Predict</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>Predict &lt;sector&gt;</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This command displays information about the effects of an
    update on a sector.  On a graphical interface, this output is also
    available in the Sector Census Window.  Currently, it supports
    population growth statistics, starvation warnings, worker
    information, and new efficiency data.

    <h3><a name="setfood">Command setfood</a></h3>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre>setfood &lt;sector list&gt; [no] [force]</pre>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This command computes for each sector in <code>&lt;sector
    list&gt;</code> the amount of food needed for full growth and sets
    the food threshold depending of the options provided. </p>

    <p>If no options are provided (e.g. <code>setfood *</code>), the
    thresholds calculated are sent to the server only if they are
    above current thresholds.  For instance, if a sector needs 35 food
    and already has a food threshold of 60, no command is sent for
    this sector.</p>

    <p>If the <code>force</code> option if present (e.g. <code>setfood
    * force</code>), the calculated thresholds replace current ones
    even when they are inferior to them. </p>

    <p>If the <code>no</code> option is present (e.g. <code>setfood *
    no</code>), the calculated thresholds replace those present in the
    internal database but aren't sent to the server. </p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> A threshold command uses one BTU.  As a
    threshold command is sent to the server for each sector in the
    list, you may consume a lot of BTUs when using this command for a
    large area. </p>

    <p><strong>Note 2:</strong> The purpose of the options
    <code>no</code> and <code>force</code> is to allow the use of the
    <a href="#dmove">dmove</a> command to move food to sectors that
    need it without spending hundreds of BTUs in the process. </p>

    <p><strong>Note 3:</strong> When using the <code>no</code> option,
    the internal database gets out of sync with the game.  You should
    issue a <code>null dump * f_dist</code> command just after to
    resync food threshods. </p>

    <h4>Examples</h4>

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd>rdb<br>
setfood * no<br>
dmove f * 67<br>
null dump * f_dist
</kbd></dt>

    <dd>First, we sync the database, Second, we set food thresholds in
    the internal database.  Then the <code>dmove</code> command moves
    food around to where it is needed.  As the internal database is
    out of sync (at least regarding food thresholds), we force a
    resync with the last command.  This serie of commands could be turned in to a single command with the <a href="#alias">alias</a> command: <br>
<code>alias lsetfood rdb;setfood $* no;dmove f $* 67;null dump $* f_dist</code>
      </dd>
</dl>
