<center><h1> Useful Hints </h1></center>

This file is intended as a list of "useful things".  It isn't organized
into any particular order, but its overall contents might be useful to
players looking for more information on the advanced features in the
client.



<p> <hr> <a name="commandline">
<h2> Command-line Usage:</h2> </a>

There are a bunch of flags that may be issued to the client at startup.
The client takes arguments of the following form:

<p> Usage:
<br>
<kbd> empire.py [-t|-x] [-n] [-I &lt;<var>include directory</var>&gt;]
	[&lt;<var>database filename</var>&gt;] </kbd>

<p> The flag '-t' instructs the client to only use text mode.  When this
flag is given, the Tk interface will not be contacted, and no graphical
window will be opened.

<p> Conversely, the flag '-x' instructs the client to only use the
graphical mode.  Although it may appear that this is the default behavior,
it differs slightly.  The default behavior is to attempt to load the
graphical interface and then revert to text if that fails.  With the -x
flag, if the graphic startup fails the client will abort with a full stack
trace.  This option is only useful when debugging a graphical connection.

<p> The '-n' flag prevents the client from automatically connecting to a
server.  This can be used to bring the client and database up while
remaining offline.

<p> Any number of -I flags may be given to list a series of directories
that will be prepended to the search path.  The search path is used to
locate the standard initialization files: TkOption, first.emp, start.emp,
connect.emp.  The default search path contains the current directory
followed by the installation directory (the directory containing the
empire.py file).  Since the default is usually sufficient, this option is
not normally necessary.

<p> At the end of the options list, the filename for a database may be
given.  If this filename is specified then the empire database will be
stored in this file.  Otherwise, the filename defaults to 'EmpDB'.



<p> <hr> <a name="refresh">
<h2> Refreshing the Display: </h2> </a>

The client updates the map display using information gathered from user
commands issued to the server.  There are two primary commands for
gathering this data: dump commands, and map commands.  Normally, dump
information is gathered via the <a href="commands.html#rdb">rdb</a> client
command.  Unfortunately, there is no automated method for obtaining map
information.  Normally the map information does not change, but
occasionally it will be necessary to refresh the display.  To aid in this
process, the default start.emp file contains an alias: maps.  The alias
"maps" will issue a "map *" followed by the equivalent of a "radar *".

<p> If the client is being used to connect to a country that has already
expanded, it may be useful to issue a "bmap *" command.  Normally the
client does not need to refresh a countries' bmap because most commands
that update the bmap are parsed by the client directly.



<p> <hr> <a name="selectors">
<h2> Simulated Empire Selectors: </h2> </a>

There are several local based commands that use a syntax that is similar to
the empire server's selector interface (EG. "* ?civ>200").  The local
commands <a href="commands.html#foreach">foreach</a>, <a
href="commands.html#Sect">Sect</a>, and <a
href="commands.html#mmove">mmove</a> can take sector selections of this
form.  Although these selectors are similar to the server's they differ
slightly, and are in general significantly more powerful.

<p> Known incompatibilities:
<ul>
<li> When accessing the owner flag, owned objects are not reported using
your numeric country id.  Instead all owned objects are always reported
with a value of '-1'.

<li> When accessing the oldowner flag, it is not really possible to get
accurate information on the actual oldowner.  (This is a result of limited
information in the dump command, and the fact that there is no practical
way of obtaining oldowner from the server.)

<li> The commodity deliver variables (EG. f_del) are not the same as the
server's.  The server returns a numeric value that encodes both the
direction and the cutoff.  This value isn't very useful, and I loathe to
implement it just to be absolutely compatible.
</ul>

<p> Extended features:

There are two additional selectors that may be used when issuing client
commands:
<dl>
<dt> sect
<dd>
	is equivalent to a combination of xloc, and yloc; an ascii string
	representing the current sector in "x,y" form.

<dt> dist
<dd>
	is equivalent to a combination of xdist, and ydist; an ascii string
	representing the sector's distribution sector.
</dl>

<p> It is also possible to embed python expressions in these selectors.
For example, the command "foreach * ?civ>mil*2" will run the command on all
sectors that have more civs than twice the number of mil in them.  In
general, any python expression may be used as long as there are no white
spaces and there are no occurrence of the ampersand character ('&') in the
expression.



<p> <hr> <a name="burst">
<h2> To burst, or not to burst: </h2> </a>

For users unfamilliar with the internals of the Ptkei client, it may not
seem obvious the differences between bursting commands and synchronizing
them.  What follows is a few simple tips on deciding when to use each of
the modes.

<dl>
<dt>
<h3> Bursting allows multiple commands to be sent and processed much
faster.</h3>
<dd>

For example, try sending the following command in normal mode:
<br>
<kbd> foreach -10:10,-5:5 foreach -10:10,-5:5 echo [sect]</kbd>
<br>
(The objective of this command is to send a few hundred echo commands to
the server.)  You should notice the command-line window scroll down as echo
commands are sent and their output is displayed.

<p> The above output may appear as fast, but there is a much faster way.
Feel free to clear the outgoing queue (via the Queue-Options menubutton
located on the bottom of the screen - the text showing something like
"213/1".)  Now send the command:
<br>
<kbd> burst foreach -10:10,-5:5 foreach -10:10,-5:5 echo [sect]</kbd>
<br>
The client will probably "freeze" for a second or two before returning with
all the echo commands fully processed.  (Use the scrollbar to review the
output.)  The simple addition of the word "burst" probably improved the
performace a hundred times or more.


<dt>
<p> <h3>Internals of burst</h3>
<dd>

In normal mode, each pending command is sent to the server only after the
client receives a command-line prompt from the previous command.  In this
mode the client only sends a command after the server has confirmed that it
is ready to receive a command.

<p> Unfortunately, this synchronization incurs a lot of latency.  The
client and server are both idling while the network is transmitting the
input and output.  Burst works by sending multiple commands to the server
without waiting for the server to respond with a command prompt.

<p> By removing the synchronization checks the client elliminates a lot of
latency.  It is important to note that burst does not improve the speed of
individual commands.  Instead it improves the time needed to process a
large number of commands.


<dt>
<p> <h3> Burst'ed commands are less stable </h3>
<dd>

If burst makes sending multiple commands faster, why not send all commands
in burst mode?  Try sending the following command:
<br>
<kbd> burst map ; update </kbd>
<br>
Expert empire players will immediately recognize that map requires an
argument.  The above command will send "update" to the map's sup-prompt.
This is probably not what is desired.  More importantly, there is no way
for the client to predict when this will occur, to avoid it, or to recover
from it.

<p> If an unexpected sub-prompt appears in the middle of a series of
bursted commands, subsequent commands will end up answering the sub prompt.
This will probably result in the original command failing, or worse,
prompting the user for appropriate action with another sub-prompt (which
will also be inappropriately answered by any pending bursted commands).  In
a nutshell, if an unexpected sub-prompt occurs in a long series of bursted
commands, the whole series will probably be seriously corrupted.


<dt>
<p> <h3> Burst is useful when using commands with known sub-prompts.</h3>
<dd>

Since Burst is too unpredictable when sending multiple commands that have
unpredictable sub-prompts, burst becomes most useful when sending a series
of commands that have entirely predictable sub-prompts.  For example, in an
earlier example, hundreds of echo commands were sent simultaneously to the
empire server.  Because echo is known to have no sub-prompts, it is a good
candidate for bursting.

<p> Most commands have very predictable prompts, but others are not as
clear.  The "move" command is a good example of a command that should
probably never be burst'ed.  (A move command could cause enemy interdiction
which causes unpredictable sub-prompts.)  Other "unstable" commands include
navigate, march, transport, explore, attack, etc.

<p> The area where burst becomes most powerful, is when used in select
macros and aliases.  Often these aliases are very predictable, and the
speed benefit of using burst is noticeable.  For example, internally the
rdb command, and the telegram/announcement sender use this feature to
significantly improve performance.  Also, the default "start.emp" file
defines many macros that utilize burst.


<dt>
<p> <h3> Burstall mode.</h3>
<dd>

The Gui interface has a "BurstAll" mode capability.  (Available from the
queue options menu.)  When this mode is enable, all commands typed in from
the keyboard will be sent to the server immediately and no synchronization
is performed.  This mode can be useful when connecting to a slow server.
(Generally most connections have decent bandwidth, but often have high
latency.)  I do not recommend this mode for most connections, as no
improvement will be noticed unless you can type faster than the connection.


<dt> <p> <h3> Miscellaneous warnings.</h3>
<dd>

<p> When using burst or burstall mode, it is important to know that all
lines will be treated by the client as if they were regular commands.
Lines that are known to be sub-prompts to the user are not know to be
sub-prompts by the client.  If they look like aliases or internal commands
they will be processed by the client!  It is important to plan out the
client's aliases so that they do not conflict with possible empire prompts.

<p> Most local commands set their own burst flags.  For example, the
command "burst rdb" will have no effect - the "rdb" command is hardwired to
use its own method.

<p> Due to a known design error, the text interface will become hung if a
bad series of burst commands are sent.  Whenever a local command that sets
its own burst flags is sent where the server is expecting a sub-prompt, the
client becomes hopelessly lost waiting for the answer to the sub-prompt.
For example, the sequence "burst map; rdb" will cause the text client to
hang.  (The GUI client will become confused, but not entirely hung as it is
still possible to manually click on the sub-prompt window and type in a
response.)
<br>
Because of this problem, there is no burst-all mode for the text-only
client.

</dl>


<p> <hr> <a name="origin">
<h2> Don't use the origin command: </h2> </a>

The empire server supports a command call "origin".  This origin command
can change the virtual coordinate system of a country.  After using this
command, all further map, dump, and information commands will use different
coordinates.  Unfortunately, there is no practical way for a "smart" client
to gracefully handle these types of coordinate shifts.

<p> Ptkei has been hardwired to block transmission of the origin command.

<p> Fortunately, there isn't a real need to have this command available.
When using the graphical interface, the "origin" of all of the graphical
maps can be seamlessly changed by pressing the right mouse button on a
sector.

<p> However, if one really desires to run the server command, it can still
be done using the <a href="commands.html#raw">raw</a> command.  For
example, the command <kbd>raw origin 2,0</kbd> would prevent client
intervention.

<p> In all likelihood, if an origin command does make it to the server,
then the local database will need to be completely reset.  This can be done
by either removing the database file manually, or selecting the reset
option from the Login window.
