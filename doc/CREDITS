Bernhard Reiter has been working with the client since the earliest beta
release.  He has provided many suggestions and reported numerous bugs.  He
has also been play testing the client on other platforms, such as Windows
NT.  By providing input on many of the early beta and alpha releases, he
has played an important role in the crucial beginning stages of
development.  His continual support in debugging code and validating new
releases is a great asset.
In addition to his role in the development, Berhnard has played the leading
role in the client's promotion and distribution.  Without Bernhard's help,
you probably would not be reading this now.


Much praise should go to the developers of the empire server.  Without
their continued support this client would server no purpose.  In
particular, the current developers of the Wolfpack source have answered
many questions, and have directly aided the development by providing a
permanent home for this client on their FTP site.


Ulf Larsson has graciously donated the multi-move tool.  He has also
provided a bestpath algorithm that will certainly find uses in many future
tools.  In addition to these code contributions, Ulf has been steadily
divulging lots of cool features that are contained within his own client!
