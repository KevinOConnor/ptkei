# Key Ideas:


# What is contained within this file:

# This file contains the underlying socket code.  Code to handle all the
# incoming data and broker all the outgoing data is contained within the
# class EmpIOQueue.  EmpIOQueue uses a number of other classes to handle
# the incoming/outgoing data.  This file also contains these other classes
# and contains the basic building block for the chained display classes.  A
# quick glance at the other files in this distribution will show that this
# is the only file that references any of the low-level empire protocols
# (EG. C_PROMPT) - all that protocol stuff is handled here.

# Note: To actually send commands, the standard method is to use the class
# empCmd.EmpParse.  Please see the documentation in empCmd for more info.


# Global variables:

# empQueue : This always points to the only instance of EmpIOQueue.  Its a
# convenience aid that probably isn't necessary..
#
# NormalHandler.msgQueue : Stores messages that the client thinks may be
# server broadcasts (EG. new telgram notifications).  It could just as
# easily be non-global - it's global for optimization/simplicity.


# The purpose of the low-level data managers:

# The "data managers" are helper classes for EmpIOQueue.  These helper
# classes essentially manage output from the server.  They strip the
# low-level empire protocol stuff from the information and transmit the
# data using a variety of classes and methods.  The classes AsyncHandler,
# LoginHandler, NormalHandler, and DummyHandler, are these "data managers".
# It is important to note that AsyncHandler and LoginHandler have special
# properties.  Both of these classes will normally have exactly one
# instance associated with them.  These single instances are associated
# with EmpIOQueue at its instantiation, and are stored in the variables
# defParse and loginParser.  To the contrary, the NormalHandler and
# DummyHandler classes will generally have multiple instances associated
# with them - one instance per queued command.


# The purpose of the chained display classes:

# Associated with many of the server commands will be client parsers.  (For
# example, the server command "read" will be transmitted to the class
# empDb.ParseRead.)  These classes are referred to as "chained" because
# they generally form a linked-list of parsers.  More than one parser might
# have interest in the server output of any given command, so a chain is
# formed where each low-level parser transmits the information to the next
# parser.  The chaining is performed by the individual parsers - a lower
# level parser might decide to not send information up the chain, thus
# hiding info.  (Which, BTW, is the basis for the "null" command - "null"
# just associates the given command with a parser that discards its input.)
# At the highest level of this parse chain, is generally the main viewer.
# The global variable viewer must support the same methods of an ordinary
# display class.  (In addition to its special methods - see
# AsyncHandler/LoginHandler for more info.)


# The use of the Queue Flags:

# The queue flags describe the current state of the command queue.  They
# determine if the connection is open/closed/paused/etc..  The more
# interesting flags, however, are the per-command transmission flags.
# These flags (QU_BURST, QU_SYNC, QU_FORCEBURST, and QU_FULLSYNC) determine
# how each command is transmitted to the server.  If empQueue.flags is set
# to one of these per-command flags, that means the connection is open,
# stable, and ready to send a command in accordance with these per-command
# flags.  empQueue.flags is set by bitwise or'ing a command's pre-flags
# with the previous command's post-flags.  The pre-flags are used to
# determine when a command should be transmitted.  The post-flags determine
# the command's environment (IE. should it secure its potential
# sub-prompts, does it need to prevent further commands from being executed
# while processing the current, etc.)  If there are zero or one commands on
# the queue, then empQueue.flags will always equal QU_BURST.

# With QU_BURST, the command is transmitted immediately; no checks are made
# to determine if the command will be sent to a sub-prompt or a command
# line.

# With QU_SYNC (the most interesting and complex mode), the command is
# guaranteed to be sent to a command-line, but can be sent prior to the
# completed processing of the previous command.  This is done by forcing
# the socket reader to pre-scan all the server data.  When a C_PROMPT
# protocol is detected, the socket reader will transmit the next command
# immediately.  This pre-scanning of the server data can significantly
# reduce the connection's latency.  (Certain commands can cause a Tk
# redraw, which may take several seconds - by sending the next command
# prior to trudging through the chained display classes, it is possible to
# keep the server busy while the client works on other processing.)

# QU_FORCEBURST is a modification of QU_BURST and QU_SYNC.  QU_FORCEBURST
# is a pledge that the command will not create any subprompts.  This is
# used by the rdb command to force QU_SYNC commands following a 'dump *' to
# downgrade to QU_BURST.  Since a 'dump *' will never create a subprompt,
# this squeezes a little more performance from the frequently used rdb
# commands.

# With QU_FULLSYNC, the command is not sent until the previous command is
# fully processed, completed, and dequeued.  This is used by smart commands
# that require either the output in entirety from the previous command or
# the ability to send commands to the server immediately.  (For example,
# the client-command 'foreach' would set QU_FULLSYNC to ensure that it can
# place a command on the queue right after it is completed - it would not
# be ideal to have a command following 'foreach xxx' pop in front of the
# foreach commands due to QU_SYNC's behavior.)
