# Key Ideas:

# What is contained within this file:

# This file contains the code necessary to "bootstrap" the other code
# files.  The code in this file has been left intentionally sparse because
# it is often translated to byte-code multiple times.


# The use of global variables throughout this project:

# In general, I dislike the use of global variables.  I have made an effort
# to document each use of global variables in each module.  (True global
# variables - not global constants.)  There are a couple of critical global
# variables that future developers should know of:
#
# viewer : The viewer class is defined in just about all modules.  This
# variable is used for reporting errors, sending commands, and many other
# functions.
#
# empDb.megaDB : This is the location of the internal database.  This
# database stores all the gathered information from the server.  Different
# databases can be dynamicaly loaded/saved to disk, but at any one time
# the client only supports a single countries' database.
#
# Although I dislike global variables, I felt it necessary to use them in
# the above circumstances.  Under normal conditions, almost all classes and
# functions require both viewer and megaDB.  It makes little sense to pass
# these variables with nearly every single call.  Also, that many
# references to the same variable is bound to cause some form of circular
# referencing, which is not a good idea(tm) in Python.
