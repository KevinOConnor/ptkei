The scripts directory contains a collection of Unix command-line scripts
that I use to create the packages that I release.  These utilities are
probably only useful if a distribution is being created, or if the sources
are being heavily updated.  Normal users should probably just ignore this
directory.

The files in this directory:

    create : This is a Unix shell script that will create the Pmw.pyc file
	from a PMW distribution.  It uses the dummyfunc.py and bundlepmw.py
	that are also in this directory.  This file needs a hard coded
	location of the PMW sources - before running on another site it
	will probably require altering.

	For more information of PMW, see the PMW web site located at:
		http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/
	or look around www.python.org for information related to PMW.

    bundlepmw.py : This is a modified version of the bundlepmw.py file that
	comes with PMW 0.8.  It has been modified so that it creates a
	minimal Pmw.py file.  It has also been modified to change the line
	"_bltOK = 0" to "_bltbusyOK = 0" due to advise from Greg McFarlane
	- the maintainer of PMW.

    dummyfunc.py : A simple script that is used to convert a Pmw.py file to
	a Pmw.pyc file.

    snapshot : This is a Unix shell script that bundles all the necessary
	files from the ptkei directory and creates a new tar file.  It
	can automatically create time dated snapshots.  This script has
	a hardcoded source directory - it will need to be edited before
	using.

    untab : Simple Unix script that converts all leading tabs to spaces.

    stript : Simple Unix script that converts all leading whitespace to
	tabs, and removes all excess end of line whitespace.

NOTE: The only really useful scripts (create and snapshot) were not
designed to be highly portable.  They are quick and dirty, and will need to
be modified to suit your needs.
